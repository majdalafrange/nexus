# Rox Nexus MVP Demo Script
**Target Duration: 2-3 minutes**

## Pre-Flight Setup (30 seconds)
1. **Show One-Pager with Pre-seeded Conflicts**

     - CRM: "Approved" (90 days old)
     - Email: "Freeze" (7 days old)
   - Point to Decision Maker: "Mark Delaney" (90 days old)
   - Show Metrics dashboard with zeros

2. **Explain Conflict Resolution Policy**
   - "Every decision is auditable via 'Why?' popovers"
   - "Shows sources, timestamps, confidence scores, and rules"
   - "Recency weights, source priors, agreement boost"

## In-Flight Demo (15 seconds)
3. **Bookmark Demo**
   - Say mock line: "We need to send the proposal by Friday at 5pm"
   - Say: "Bookmark that"
   - **Expected Result**: Banner appears instantly
     - "ðŸ“Œ Commitment bookmarked: Send proposal (Fri 5:00 PM ET)"

## Main Storytime Demo (45 seconds)
4. **Voice Debrief** (30-40 seconds)
   ```
   "Budget resolved today, we got final approval from finance this morning. 
   New decision maker is David Chenâ€”C-H-E-Nâ€”he's taking over from Mark. 
   Proposal due this Friday 5pm Eastern. 
   Add follow-up task for SOC2 compliance review Monday 9am."
   ```

5. **Real-time Processing**
   - Show stopwatch starting
   - Show "Listening..." indicator
   - Show "Processing..." state

## Outcome Demonstration (60 seconds)
6. **One-Pager Updates** (appears in <10 seconds)
   - **Actionable Insight** appears first:

   - Point out stopwatch stops when insight renders

7. **Show Auto-Applied Changes**
   - SOC2 follow-up task (auto-applied, show Undo button)
   - Normalized date: "Fri Sep 19, 2025 5:00 PM ET"
   - **Demonstrate Undo**: Click undo on task, show immediate rollback

   - Decision Maker change: Mark â†’ David Chen
   - Confidence score: 0.76
   - [Apply] and [Discard] buttons visible

   - **Popover shows**:
     - Sources: CRM (Mark, 90d), Email (David Chan, 5d), Debrief (David Chen, today)
     - Recency weights: 0.12, 0.85, 1.0
     - Source priors: 0.10, 0.30, 0.40
     - Final confidence: 0.76
     - Rule: "High blast radius: stage if <0.90"

10. **Metrics Dashboard**
    - Conflicts detected: 3
    - Auto-resolved: 2
    - Staged: 1
    - Blocked: 0
    - Time-to-Insight: 7.8s
    - Precision@Apply: 100%

## Key Demo Points to Emphasize
- **Speed**: <10 second time-to-insight
- **Transparency**: Every decision is auditable
- **Safety**: Reversible autonomy with undo/staging
- **Intelligence**: Handles messy, conflicting data
